python3 -m http.server is a command that allows you to quickly set up a local web server using Python 3. It starts a simple HTTP server in the current directory and serves files from there.

Here's how it works:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory you want to serve files from.
Type python3 -m http.server and press Enter.
The server should start running and you should see a message like "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000".
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
You should now see the files in the directory you started the server from.
This command is useful for quickly sharing files with others on your local network or for testing web applications. However, it's important to note that this server is not secure and should not be used in a production environment.
